Disinter removes broken runreports from the game. It basically cleans out your error log and handles it a bit more nicely.
Mod devs that produce broken runreports can turn on the export function to see what runreports are actually produced. There's no real need to keep them around though.


F.A.Q.

#### Why did you choose the name 'Disinter' instead of a more common word.
It doesn't really do anything cool. Cool names for cool mods.

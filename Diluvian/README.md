### Diluvian ###

Diluvian is a difficulty mod. It adds a harder than Monsoon difficulty to the game, with various unique modifiers.

* Difficulty Scaling: +75%
* Player Health Regeneration: -60%
* Monster Health Regeneration: +1.5% of MaxHP per second out of combat
* Oneshot Protection: Removed.
* Elites: 20% cheaper.
* Shrine of Blood: Cost hidden.

Upon completion the main game ending on Diluvian, you unlock a second difficulty. It's completely bullshit. It's not even fair. Have fun, you masochist.

### Credits ###

* Avizvul for making the new primary difficulty icons.
* Horus for providing an additional one.
* People who keep asking when it will be updated for providing some pressure to update.

## Changelog ##

* **2.0.2** Reduce memory footprint by not hooking for no reason. Corrected Avizvul's capitalization. Fixed a typo. @me when you beat the game on Diluvian.
* **2.0.1** Fixed the regen multiplier actually being -100%. *oops*. Also have a [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKfAw8TZtq8).
* **2.0.0** Updated for game update 1.0.  New icon, new difficulty. Re-evaluated One Shot Protection. Added config to choose icon artist.
* **1.0.5** Health regen no longer applies to characterbodies with invulnerability or invulberability phases.
* **1.0.4** Updated for Artifacts, by... removing the monsters spawning after tp completion. Code just wouldn't work. I'll compensate for this in a future update, but for now, I want people able to play Diluvian again.
* **1.0.3** Added some intermod compatibility. No balance changes, I'm quite happy where it is now.
* **1.0.2**: `   ` -> `Player Luck: Reduced in some places.`. *Get off your high horse, lucky boy.*
* **1.0.2**: `Player  Health Regeneration: -50%` -> `Player  Health Regeneration: -60%` . *Was worried regen changes would screw with mine. They don't, but make it a bit more easier. We can't have that.*
* **1.0.2**: `Shrine of Blood: Always 99%` -> `Shrine of Blood: Cost hidden`. *The blood shrine cost was always intended to be a flavor thing. But you know what's more fun? Not knowing how much life you're going to pay.*
* **1.0.1**: `Monster  Health Regeneration: 1% of maxHP` -> `Monster  Health Regeneration: 1.5% of maxHP out of combat`. *While the regen did make things harder, it did so at the cost of being really annoying to downright impossible if your damage was falling behind. To compensate for this nerf, they've been buffed.*
